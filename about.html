												<h3>Our Story</h3>
												<p> Harvinder Singh founded Bestica in 2005 because user experience design was evolving into a necessity for businesses and organizations around the world. A wide gap in the industry persisted from a talent perspective, because recruiting agencies didn’t understand the emerging facets of UX design or know what to look for in candidates.</p>

												<p>Companies everywhere sought bright designers with experience and vision, and Singh launched Bestica to facilitate those connections.</p>

												<p>Shortly after its launch, Bestica expanded its services from Fortune 500 companies to the U.S. federal government. Today, we engage with numerous government organizations, having earned a reputation for meeting their needs in accordance with federal codes and budgets. Bestica understands the importance of streamlined contract jobs or finding qualified personnel with the right security clearance and experience.</p>

												<p>By working in the niche of UX design, instead of trying to handle a broad range of staffing needs, Bestica focuses on what it does best: putting UX design professionals to work at companies where they belong.</p>

												<p>
												I founded Bestica with the goal of created a well-designed, highly trained team that empowers companies by matching them to the best candidates in their industry. The idea of facilitating this win-win situation brought me great happiness, because I’ve always found that the highest level of innovation and creativity comes when companies and employees are excited about working together. It’s the kind of match that benefits the whole world.
												</p>
												<p>
												Our customer’s success is our success, and we’ll continue connecting our candidates and companies to create a flawless match. At the same time, our work is never done. To remain one of the nation’s leading staffing firms, we stay true to our mission statement and values in the way we run our business, train our staff, and talk about our corporate goals. That mission statement is:
												</p>
												<p>“To serve as a partner by finding “the best of the best” in user experience design and information technology, and then place this world class talent at world class companies.</p>
												<ul>
													<li>If you’re seeking streamlined solutions for your Government projects, we have the experience and capabilities to accomplish them. We invite you to contact us and start the conversation about your project needs.</li>
